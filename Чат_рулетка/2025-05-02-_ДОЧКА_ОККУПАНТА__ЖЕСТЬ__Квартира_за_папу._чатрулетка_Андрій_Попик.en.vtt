00:54:55.559 --> 00:54:57.589 align:start position:0%

Therefore, <00:54:55.779><c>I </c><00:54:55.999><c>didn’t </c><00:54:56.219><c>see </c><00:54:56.439><c>any </c><00:54:56.659><c>point </c><00:54:56.879><c>in </c><00:54:57.099><c>writing </c><00:54:57.319><c>anything</c>

00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
Therefore, I didn’t see any point in writing anything

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.150 align:start position:0%
 
Well, <01:05:27.209><c>maybe </c><01:05:27.658><c>because </c><01:05:28.107><c>sodium </c><01:05:28.556><c>chloride</c>

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:29.160 align:start position:0%

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
and it turns on for her.  So we
 

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.110 align:start position:0%
and it turns on for her.  So we
had <01:12:16.735><c>to </c><01:12:16.950><c>endure </c><01:12:17.165><c>that </c><01:12:17.380><c>seven </c><01:12:17.595><c>times </c><01:12:17.810><c>seven </c><01:12:18.025><c>a </c><01:12:18.240><c>year </c><01:12:18.455><c>was </c><01:12:18.670><c>like</c>
