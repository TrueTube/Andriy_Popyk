00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
everything was there, everything was still mined.  Well then
 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.429 align:start position:0%

They, <00:06:12.526><c>they </c><00:06:12.932><c>just </c><00:06:13.338><c>come </c><00:06:13.744><c>up, </c><00:06:14.150><c>if </c><00:06:14.556><c>they</c>

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
They, they just come up, if they

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.629 align:start position:0%
that.  Therefore, if they break through, it

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:50.599 align:start position:0%
on the palm of your hand, you could just mouth over them and that’s it.  So, I
 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:53.029 align:start position:0%
on the palm of your hand, you could just mouth over them and that’s it.  So, I
also <00:07:50.924><c>say, </c><00:07:51.249><c>and, </c><00:07:51.574><c>uh, </c><00:07:51.899><c>the </c><00:07:52.224><c>uncle </c><00:07:52.549><c>says, </c><00:07:52.874><c>there</c>

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:55.879 align:start position:0%
was no order.  There was no order.
 

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:59.550 align:start position:0%
was no order.  There was no order.

So, there are 60 units of armored vehicles,
 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.149 align:start position:0%
So, there are 60 units of armored vehicles,

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:03.869 align:start position:0%
more than 10,000 people.  And the order
tells <00:08:02.334><c>them </c><00:08:02.509><c>that </c><00:08:02.684><c>no, </c><00:08:02.859><c>it </c><00:08:03.034><c>can’t </c><00:08:03.209><c>be.  </c><00:08:03.384><c>In </c><00:08:03.559><c>short,</c>
