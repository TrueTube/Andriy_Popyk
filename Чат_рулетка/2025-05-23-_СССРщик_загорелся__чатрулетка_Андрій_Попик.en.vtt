00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
why we attacked, because
 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.550 align:start position:0%
why we attacked, because
you <00:03:18.371><c>could </c><00:03:18.822><c>move </c><00:03:19.273><c>on </c><00:03:19.724><c>from </c><00:03:20.175><c>showing </c><00:03:20.626><c>off </c><00:03:21.077><c>to</c>

So you just started talking, started,
 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.429 align:start position:0%
So you just started talking, started,
listen <00:03:26.139><c>to </c><00:03:26.479><c>me, </c><00:03:26.819><c>shut </c><00:03:27.159><c>up, </c><00:03:27.499><c>started </c><00:03:27.839><c>saying:</c>

listen to me, shut up, started saying:
 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:32.110 align:start position:0%
listen to me, shut up, started saying:
“We <00:03:28.859><c>want, </c><00:03:29.279><c>we </c><00:03:29.699><c>want, </c><00:03:30.119><c>we </c><00:03:30.539><c>want, </c><00:03:30.959><c>we </c><00:03:31.379><c>want.”  </c><00:03:31.799><c>And</c>

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.149 align:start position:0%
“We want, we want, we want, we want.”  And
so <00:03:32.525><c>Russia </c><00:03:32.930><c>decided </c><00:03:33.335><c>that, </c><00:03:33.740><c>no </c><00:03:34.145><c>matter </c><00:03:34.550><c>what </c><00:03:34.955><c>you</c>

so Russia decided that, no matter what you
wanted, <00:03:35.839><c>they </c><00:03:36.519><c>went </c><00:03:37.199><c>two </c><00:03:37.879><c>steps </c><00:03:38.559><c>forward </c><00:03:39.239><c>so</c>

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
wanted, they went two steps forward so
 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.429 align:start position:0%
wanted, they went two steps forward so
that <00:03:40.860><c>you </c><00:03:42.000><c>wouldn’t</c>

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn’t

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.949 align:start position:0%
want it, well, you wouldn’t be able to want it.  This is what we do,
then <00:03:47.426><c>we </c><00:03:48.092><c>take </c><00:03:48.758><c>two </c><00:03:49.424><c>steps </c><00:03:50.090><c>forward </c><00:03:50.756><c>and</c>

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
then we take two steps forward and
 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.710 align:start position:0%
