differ from the return of Crimea or Belgorod
 

00:48:06.839 --> 00:48:08.349 align:start position:0%

for example

00:48:08.349 --> 00:48:08.359 align:start position:0%
for example
 

00:48:08.359 --> 00:48:10.670 align:start position:0%

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
about how it differs Well they gave Kherson You are
 

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.349 align:start position:0%
about how it differs Well they gave Kherson You are

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%

look <00:48:22.835><c>there </c><00:48:23.030><c>will </c><00:48:23.225><c>be </c><00:48:23.420><c>the </c><00:48:23.615><c>only </c><00:48:23.810><c>bridge </c><00:48:24.005><c>with </c><00:48:24.200><c>Crimea</c>

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
look there will be the only bridge with Crimea
 

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:25.950 align:start position:0%
look there will be the only bridge with Crimea
and <00:48:24.572><c>it </c><00:48:24.704><c>will </c><00:48:24.836><c>collapse </c><00:48:24.968><c>a </c><00:48:25.100><c>little </c><00:48:25.232><c>bit </c><00:48:25.364><c>for </c><00:48:25.496><c>example </c><00:48:25.628><c>when </c><00:48:25.760><c>they</c>
