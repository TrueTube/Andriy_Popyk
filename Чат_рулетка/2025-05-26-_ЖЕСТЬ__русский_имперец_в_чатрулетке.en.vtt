00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
Well, so I understand correctly that the
 

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.470 align:start position:0%
Well, so I understand correctly that the
monarch <00:11:22.040><c>himself </c><00:11:22.400><c>will </c><00:11:22.760><c>adopt </c><00:11:23.120><c>the </c><00:11:23.480><c>constitution</c>

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
monarch himself will adopt the constitution
 

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
monarch himself will adopt the constitution
alone?

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.990 align:start position:0%
 
Let's <00:11:29.154><c>assume </c><00:11:29.428><c>so, </c><00:11:29.702><c>right?  </c><00:11:29.976><c>The </c><00:11:30.250><c>Prime </c><00:11:30.524><c>Minister </c><00:11:30.798><c>cannot,</c>

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
Let's assume so, right?  The Prime Minister cannot,
 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.750 align:start position:0%
Let's assume so, right?  The Prime Minister cannot,
because <00:11:31.160><c>he </c><00:11:31.320><c>is </c><00:11:31.480><c>no </c><00:11:31.640><c>longer </c><00:11:31.800><c>a </c><00:11:31.960><c>monarch.  </c><00:11:32.120><c>A </c><00:11:32.280><c>monarch </c><00:11:32.440><c>is </c><00:11:32.600><c>a</c>

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
because he is no longer a monarch.  A monarch is a
 

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
because he is no longer a monarch.  A monarch is a
mono-divisional ruler.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
mono-divisional ruler.
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.190 align:start position:0%
mono-divisional ruler.
So, <00:11:35.685><c>that </c><00:11:36.010><c>is, </c><00:11:36.335><c>it </c><00:11:36.660><c>turns </c><00:11:36.985><c>out </c><00:11:37.310><c>that </c><00:11:37.635><c>way,</c>

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
So, that is, it turns out that way,
 

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.350 align:start position:0%
So, that is, it turns out that way,
look, <00:11:38.526><c>the </c><00:11:38.852><c>monarch, </c><00:11:39.178><c>yes, </c><00:11:39.504><c>will </c><00:11:39.830><c>be </c><00:11:40.156><c>the</c>

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
implement them, and the judicial power, everything is he,
 

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.470 align:start position:0%
implement them, and the judicial power, everything is he,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes, he is limited by the constitution, yes.
 

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.269 align:start position:0%
yes, he is limited by the constitution, yes.
