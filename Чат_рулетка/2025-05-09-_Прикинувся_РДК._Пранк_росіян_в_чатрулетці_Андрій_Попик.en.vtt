that the costs for large territories are

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
large territory then?  Maybe then we should give up the
 

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.430 align:start position:0%
large territory then?  Maybe then we should give up the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
