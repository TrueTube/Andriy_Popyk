psychological trick.  In theory I
 

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:01.230 align:start position:0%
psychological trick.  In theory I

should <00:42:01.593><c>be </c><00:42:01.946><c>a </c><00:42:02.299><c>practice.  </c><00:42:02.652><c>Well, </c><00:42:03.005><c>that </c><00:42:03.358><c>is,</c>

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
should be a practice.  Well, that is,
 

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.910 align:start position:0%
should be a practice.  Well, that is,

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
seriously true.  So we
 

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.950 align:start position:0%
seriously true.  So we
