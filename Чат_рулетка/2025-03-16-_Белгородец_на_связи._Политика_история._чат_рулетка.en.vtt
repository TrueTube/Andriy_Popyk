she a subsidized region because they
 

00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:10.150 align:start position:0%

some taxes to the local budget and
 

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.790 align:start position:0%
some taxes to the local budget and

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
then part of it is returned from the federal
 

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.470 align:start position:0%
then part of it is returned from the federal
so <00:11:14.944><c>if </c><00:11:15.088><c>they </c><00:11:15.232><c>don't </c><00:11:15.376><c>take </c><00:11:15.520><c>federal </c><00:11:15.664><c>taxes </c><00:11:15.808><c>at </c><00:11:15.952><c>all</c>
