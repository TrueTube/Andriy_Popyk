00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
n’t know what could happen in a year. So
 

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.270 align:start position:0%
n’t know what could happen in a year. So
many <00:35:04.020><c>more </c><00:35:04.400><c>guys </c><00:35:04.780><c>could </c><00:35:05.160><c>fall.</c>
