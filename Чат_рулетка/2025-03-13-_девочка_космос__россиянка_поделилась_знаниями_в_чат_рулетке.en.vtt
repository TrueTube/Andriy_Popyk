this comet really was which I
saw

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
saw
 

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:58.189 align:start position:0%

and <00:16:54.147><c>and </c><00:16:54.494><c>in </c><00:16:54.841><c>short </c><00:16:55.188><c>well </c><00:16:55.535><c>I </c><00:16:55.882><c>was </c><00:16:56.229><c>probably </c><00:16:56.576><c>years </c><00:16:56.923><c>old </c><00:16:57.270><c>then</c>

00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%

and and in short well I was probably years old then
I <00:16:58.759><c>just </c><00:16:59.319><c>like </c><00:16:59.879><c>it </c><00:17:00.439><c>was </c><00:17:00.999><c>so </c><00:17:01.559><c>it</c>

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
I just like it was so it
 

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.510 align:start position:0%
I just like it was so it

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
like it's cool I have like a telescope
 

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.110 align:start position:0%
like it's cool I have like a telescope
there well this It's like this

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
