00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
operation, I think that if something
 

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.510 align:start position:0%
operation, I think that if something
is <00:21:05.900><c>done, </c><00:21:06.040><c>then </c><00:21:06.180><c>it </c><00:21:06.320><c>will </c><00:21:06.460><c>clearly </c><00:21:06.600><c>not </c><00:21:06.740><c>work </c><00:21:06.880><c>out</c>

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
is done, then it will clearly not work out
 

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.909 align:start position:0%
is done, then it will clearly not work out
so <00:21:07.780><c>that </c><00:21:08.040><c>a </c><00:21:08.300><c>huge </c><00:21:08.560><c>number </c><00:21:08.820><c>will </c><00:21:09.080><c>die </c><00:21:09.340><c>there, </c><00:21:09.600><c>yes, </c><00:21:09.860><c>now </c><00:21:10.120><c>there </c><00:21:10.380><c>are </c><00:21:10.640><c>also</c>

00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:14.110 align:start position:0%
so that a huge number will die there, yes, now there are also
 

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.430 align:start position:0%

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
quite a few victims on all sides, but I
 

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.990 align:start position:0%
quite a few victims on all sides, but I
still <00:21:16.760><c>think </c><00:21:17.080><c>that </c><00:21:17.400><c>the </c><00:21:17.720><c>outcome </c><00:21:18.040><c>will </c><00:21:18.360><c>be</c>

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
still think that the outcome will be
 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.430 align:start position:0%
still think that the outcome will be

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
When it is, of course, we will be able to
 

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.950 align:start position:0%
When it is, of course, we will be able to
draw <00:32:33.143><c>some </c><00:32:33.526><c>conclusions, </c><00:32:33.909><c>well, </c><00:32:34.292><c>somehow </c><00:32:34.675><c>come</c>

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
draw some conclusions, well, somehow come
 

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:38.110 align:start position:0%
draw some conclusions, well, somehow come
to <00:32:35.426><c>a </c><00:32:35.892><c>common </c><00:32:36.358><c>opinion.  </c><00:32:36.824><c>Again, </c><00:32:37.290><c>it </c><00:32:37.756><c>depends</c>

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
to a common opinion.  Again, it depends
 

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.990 align:start position:0%
to a common opinion.  Again, it depends
on <00:32:38.342><c>how </c><00:32:38.564><c>things </c><00:32:38.786><c>turn </c><00:32:39.008><c>out </c><00:32:39.230><c>in </c><00:32:39.452><c>the </c><00:32:39.674><c>future.</c>

And so for now this question, I think
 

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:47.310 align:start position:0%
And so for now this question, I think
, <00:32:44.834><c>well, </c><00:32:45.149><c>for </c><00:32:45.464><c>the </c><00:32:45.779><c>next </c><00:32:46.094><c>five </c><00:32:46.409><c>years </c><00:32:46.724><c>it </c><00:32:47.039><c>will</c>

00:32:49.789 --> 00:32:49.799 align:start position:0%
also remain a question.  That is
 

00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:52.310 align:start position:0%
also remain a question.  That is
, <00:32:50.101><c>it </c><00:32:50.403><c>turns </c><00:32:50.705><c>out </c><00:32:51.007><c>that </c><00:32:51.309><c>our </c><00:32:51.611><c>opinion </c><00:32:51.913><c>should</c>

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
, it turns out that our opinion should
 

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.990 align:start position:0%
, it turns out that our opinion should
depend <00:32:52.710><c>on </c><00:32:53.100><c>what </c><00:32:53.490><c>historians </c><00:32:53.880><c>write.</c>

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
depend on what historians write.
 

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.629 align:start position:0%
depend on what historians write.
Well, <00:32:56.215><c>not </c><00:32:56.430><c>historians, </c><00:32:56.645><c>but </c><00:32:56.860><c>at </c><00:32:57.075><c>least </c><00:32:57.290><c>we </c><00:32:57.505><c>will </c><00:32:57.720><c>be </c><00:32:57.935><c>able </c><00:32:58.150><c>to</c>

Well, not historians, but at least we will be able to
 

00:32:58.639 --> 00:33:00.590 align:start position:0%
Well, not historians, but at least we will be able to

00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
draw some conclusion in five years and
 

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.389 align:start position:0%
draw some conclusion in five years and

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.350 align:start position:0%
but for some reason you have already concluded that

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
Russia did not attack, but it did.  So,
 

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.789 align:start position:0%
Russia did not attack, but it did.  So,

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.310 align:start position:0%
called an operation.  And so I think
that <00:33:44.177><c>it's, </c><00:33:44.514><c>well, </c><00:33:44.851><c>needed </c><00:33:45.188><c>for </c><00:33:45.525><c>something.  </c><00:33:45.862><c>Well, </c><00:33:46.199><c>I</c>

just that there is a difference, that war

is, well, it’s difficult to answer this question,
I <00:34:05.749><c>guess.  </c><00:34:05.939><c>I </c><00:34:06.129><c>think </c><00:34:06.319><c>this </c><00:34:06.509><c>is </c><00:34:06.699><c>an </c><00:34:06.889><c>operation, </c><00:34:07.079><c>as</c>

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
I guess.  I think this is an operation, as
 

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.389 align:start position:0%
I guess.  I think this is an operation, as

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
if, when it is recognized as a war, I
 

00:34:09.399 --> 00:34:11.790 align:start position:0%
if, when it is recognized as a war, I
think <00:34:09.765><c>that </c><00:34:10.131><c>the </c><00:34:10.497><c>war </c><00:34:10.863><c>can </c><00:34:11.229><c>simply </c><00:34:11.595><c>be</c>

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
think that the war can simply be
 

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.589 align:start position:0%
think that the war can simply be

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
and what is war?  If planes and
 

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.069 align:start position:0%
and what is war?  If planes and
tanks <00:36:12.556><c>are </c><00:36:12.672><c>bombed, </c><00:36:12.788><c>is </c><00:36:12.904><c>that </c><00:36:13.020><c>already </c><00:36:13.136><c>a </c><00:36:13.252><c>war </c><00:36:13.368><c>or </c><00:36:13.484><c>is </c><00:36:13.600><c>it </c><00:36:13.716><c>still </c><00:36:13.832><c>a</c>
