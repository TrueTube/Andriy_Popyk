Israel well as you understand that is the
 

00:12:19.199 --> 00:12:20.710 align:start position:0%
Israel well as you understand that is the

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
intersect genetically then
 

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.150 align:start position:0%
intersect genetically then
