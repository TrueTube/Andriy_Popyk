00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
Well, it's hard to
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.910 align:start position:0%
Well, it's hard to
say.  <00:01:01.719><c>There </c><00:01:02.239><c>is </c><00:01:02.759><c>no </c><00:01:03.279><c>specific </c><00:01:03.799><c>topic.</c>

Why do you think Russia and Ukraine,
 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.789 align:start position:0%
Why do you think Russia and Ukraine,

, unfortunately.
 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.830 align:start position:0%
, unfortunately.
So,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
So,
 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.710 align:start position:0%
So,
circumstances.  <00:01:18.300><c>Why </c><00:01:18.760><c>are </c><00:01:19.220><c>they </c><00:01:19.680><c>fighting?</c>

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.950 align:start position:0%
 
Because <00:01:22.986><c>there </c><00:01:23.252><c>is </c><00:01:23.518><c>a </c><00:01:23.784><c>conflict </c><00:01:24.050><c>of </c><00:01:24.316><c>interest.</c>

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
Because there is a conflict of interest.
 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
Because there is a conflict of interest.
Okay, <00:01:26.240><c>please </c><00:01:26.520><c>clarify.</c>

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 align:start position:0%

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
Well, Russia has its own vision of the situation, and
 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.550 align:start position:0%
Well, Russia has its own vision of the situation, and
Ukraine <00:01:32.575><c>has </c><00:01:32.830><c>its </c><00:01:33.085><c>own.  </c><00:01:33.340><c>So, </c><00:01:33.595><c>why </c><00:01:33.850><c>the </c><00:01:34.105><c>war?  </c><00:01:34.360><c>Well,</c>

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
Ukraine has its own.  So, why the war?  Well,
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.590 align:start position:0%
Ukraine has its own.  So, why the war?  Well,
look, <00:01:34.933><c>visions </c><00:01:35.306><c>are </c><00:01:35.679><c>different </c><00:01:36.052><c>- </c><00:01:36.425><c>that's </c><00:01:36.798><c>normal.</c>

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
look, visions are different - that's normal.
 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.389 align:start position:0%
look, visions are different - that's normal.
Different <00:01:37.864><c>people </c><00:01:38.128><c>and </c><00:01:38.392><c>different </c><00:01:38.656><c>countries </c><00:01:38.920><c>have</c>

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
Different people and different countries have
 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.350 align:start position:0%
Different people and different countries have
different <00:01:39.927><c>visions.  </c><00:01:40.455><c>Why </c><00:01:40.983><c>are </c><00:01:41.511><c>they </c><00:01:42.039><c>fighting?</c>

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
different visions.  Why are they fighting?
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.789 align:start position:0%
different visions.  Why are they fighting?
Because <00:01:42.920><c>it </c><00:01:43.480><c>is </c><00:01:44.040><c>critically </c><00:01:44.600><c>different.</c>

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
Because it is critically different.
 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.030 align:start position:0%
Because it is critically different.
And <00:01:46.056><c>so </c><00:01:46.313><c>here, </c><00:01:46.570><c>you </c><00:01:46.827><c>see, </c><00:01:47.084><c>it </c><00:01:47.341><c>turns </c><00:01:47.598><c>out </c><00:01:47.855><c>that </c><00:01:48.112><c>there</c>

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
And so here, you see, it turns out that there
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.310 align:start position:0%
And so here, you see, it turns out that there
may <00:01:49.408><c>be </c><00:01:49.776><c>disagreements </c><00:01:50.144><c>there </c><00:01:50.512><c>in </c><00:01:50.880><c>some</c>

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 align:start position:0%

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
economic sense, there in something else, but
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.830 align:start position:0%
economic sense, there in something else, but
here <00:01:54.248><c>it </c><00:01:54.496><c>is </c><00:01:54.744><c>a </c><00:01:54.992><c>question </c><00:01:55.240><c>of </c><00:01:55.488><c>security.  </c><00:01:55.736><c>I </c><00:01:55.984><c>mean, </c><00:01:56.232><c>well,</c>

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
here it is a question of security.  I mean, well,
 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.590 align:start position:0%
here it is a question of security.  I mean, well,
each <00:01:57.479><c>side </c><00:01:58.118><c>thinks </c><00:01:58.757><c>it's </c><00:01:59.396><c>a</c>

each side thinks it's a
